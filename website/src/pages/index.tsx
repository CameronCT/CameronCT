                            Hello! I am a <span className="font-semibold text-orange-500">Full Stack Developer</span>.
                            <br/><br/>
                            My main passion is web-game development, however I regularly make portfolio sites for friends, contribute to other projects including my own or just game out.
                            <br/><br/>
                            In 2017, I became a pro-level typist formerly having a <span className="font-semibold text-orange-500">world record</span> with 267 words per minute on TypeRacer. Though technically it was the <span className="font-semibold">second highest</span> speed at the time, <i>buuuuuuuut</i> I recorded it first so... {'>:)'}
                            <br/><br/>
                            Two years later in 2019 I also became a <span className="font-semibold text-orange-500">professional esports player</span> when I qualified for the Quake Pro League in Lucca, Italy. Though I later travelled to Katowice, Poland for IEM Katowice 2020 where I got relegated from the league just as fast!

                        Inside and outside of my work and projects I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow and improve. 
                        Here's a list of things that I'm working on:
